# About me

Hi, there! I am a third-year undergraduate student from Tsinghua University, majoring in computer Science and Technology. Currently, I am interested in computer graphics and computer vision, advised by [Prof. Kun Xu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~kun/). And I am doing an internship at Megvii Research Lab on vision base model. Here is my [curriculum vitae](uploads/resume.pdf).
